# 🔐 Security Policy

Thanks for your interest in the security of this project. I take all reports of potential vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in keeping things safe.

## 📦 Supported Versions

I currently maintain only the latest version of this project.

| Version | Supported  |
| ------- | ---------  |
| latest  | ✅        |
| older   | ❌        |

## 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, **please do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately to me through one of the following:

- 📧 Email: [wasif.mostofa08@gmail.com]
- 🌐 Website: [https://wasif.web.app](https://wasif.web.app)

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce, if possible
- Any logs, screenshots, or other helpful context

I’ll do my best to respond within **3–5 business days**.

## ❌ What Will Get a Report Declined

To keep things focused and productive, I will **not accept reports** that fall into the following categories:

- Reports about **outdated dependencies** without a clear, exploitable vulnerability
- **Theoretical issues** with no real-world impact or proof-of-concept
- **Automated scanner output** without actionable context or explanation
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks that require unrealistic conditions (e.g., unlimited input or traffic)
- Issues that are already **publicly known and documented**
- Social engineering, phishing, or physical security vulnerabilities
- Reports targeting third-party services, infrastructure, or tools not maintained in this repository

If you're unsure whether something qualifies, feel free to ask — better safe than sorry.

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

I kindly ask that you:
- Give me time to investigate and patch the issue before disclosing it publicly
- Avoid testing in ways that could negatively affect users or services
- Keep the information confidential until it has been addressed

Thank you for helping make this project safer for everyone 🙏
